# Setup
I used this demo project to develop a C command parser, which needs to be added separately to the project root since it is its own repository. 
* clone this repo into your workspace
* create a 'lib' directory in the root of this project
* clone https://github.com/db-electronics/C_CommandParser into the lib directory
